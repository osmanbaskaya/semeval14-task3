some prediction of general relativity differ significantly from those of classical physics , especially concern the passage of time , the geometry of space , the motion of body in free fall , and the propagation of light .example of such difference include gravitational time dilation , gravitational lensing , the gravitational redshift of light , and the gravitational time delay .the prediction of general relativity have be confirm in all observation and experiment to date .although general relativity be not the only relativistic theory of gravity , it be the simplest theory that be consistent with experimental datum .	General relativity , a revolution in physics especially in field such as time passage and space geometry , have so far be consistent with all experimental datum .
dna banking be the secure , long term storage of a individual 's genetic material .dna be most commonly extract from blood , but can also be obtain from cheek cell , saliva , or other tissue .dna can be bank at any time during a person 's life , but it be particularly urgent for the elderly and terminally ill .once a person be bury or cremate , it be difficult or impossible to obtain a dna sample .	dna banking be aim at store the genetic material and can be do at any age .
because the saddle chair be higher than a normal office chair , the desk have to be higher as well .for this purpose there be desk that can be electronically or mechanically adjust to fit the user .a saddle chair can also be use with a normal office desk , but then the desk have to be lift up with height extension piece .the saddle chair seat be either solid or divide .a divided seat reduce pressure on the genitals and lower the temperature in the genital area .a divided seat be think to be healthier , especially for man , than a solid seat .	sit on a saddle chair differ from sit on a conventional chair .
in many bottom feeder , a mechanism to deal with substrate be often necessary .in the case of some organism such as sea cucumber , the sand be usually pass through the body .in fish , sand will be pump out of the mouth through the gill slit .	bottom feeder generally have some means of deal with sand .
this be a special form of cast and mold formation .if the chemistry be right , the organism -lrb- or fragment of organism -rrb- can act as a nucleus for the precipitation of mineral such as siderite , result in a nodule form around it .if this happen rapidly before significant decay to the organic tissue , very fine three-dimensional morphological detail can be preserve .nodule from the Carboniferous Mazon Creek fossil bed of Illinois , USA , be among the best document example of such mineralisation .	nodule from the Carboniferous Mazon Creek fossil bed be among the best document example because the organism cause the precipitation and subsequent nodule shortly after decay due to the ideal chemistry of the area .
Scientific study have find that numerous brain area show altered activity in patient suffer from depression , and this have encourage advocate of various theory that seek to identify a biochemical origin of the disease , as oppose to theory that emphasize psychological or situational cause .among the theory of a biologically base cause of depression be those involve genetics and circadian rhythm , but the most prominent and widely research be the monoamine hypothesis .	as multiple study have show , the brain of individual suffer from depression show altered neurological activity , lead researcher to hypothesize multiple biological cause of depression such as genetics , circadian rhythm , and monoamine .
black hole of stellar mass be expect to form when very massive star collapse at the end of they life cycle .after a black hole have form it can continue to grow by absorb mass from its surroundings .by absorb other star and merge with other black hole , supermassive black hole of million of solar mass may form .there be general consensus that supermassive black hole exist in the center of most galaxy .	black hole , believe to be at the center of galaxy and continuously grow , be form when massive star die .
the Laser Camera System -lrb- LCS -rrb- be short-range , high precision autosynchronous triangulation scanner .the camera use a laser to measure the distance between itself and point on a target and be able to create a three-dimensional representation of the area it have scan .	lc be a short-range autosynchronous triangulation scanner able of produce 3d model of scan area .
the Iron Hypothesis have be consider as a means of global engineering , because a small amount of hematite -lrb- micrometre-sized iron particle -rrb- could potentially have a considerable effect on the atmosphere .`` give I a half a tanker of iron and I 'll give you the next ice age , '' Martin once say jokingly .the reality may be much more modest : test in 2002 suggest that between 10,000 and 100,000 carbon atom be sink for each iron atom add to the water , which mean that it might be possible to sequester 1 billion tonne of co2 for as little as 30,000 tonne of iron .to put this number into perspective , this be about 10 % of co2 human have produce in year 2011 alone .	though micrometer-sized iron particle can have drastic effect on atmosphere , they extent of pollution be negligable in comparison to co2 make by human .
there be typically 40 million bacterial cell in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cell in a millilitre of fresh water .there be approximately 5 × 10 ^ 30 bacterium on Earth , form a biomass that exceed that of all plant and animal .bacterium be vital in recycle nutrient , with many step in nutrient cycle depend on these organism , such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction .	bacterium play a key role in the recycle process of nutrient and there exist a huge number of bacterium on we planet such that a milliliter of fresh water can contain up to a million bacterial cell .
the mental lexicon differ from the lexicon in that it be not just a general collection of word ; instead , it deal with how those word be activate , store , process , and retrieve by each speaker .a individual 's mental lexicon change and grow as new word be learn and be always develop , but there be several theorist that argue exactly how this occur .some theory about the mental lexicon include the Spectrum Theory , the dual-coding theory , Chomsky 's Nativist theory , as well as the Semantic Network Theory .	the development of the mental lexicon in bilingual child have increase in research over recent year .
dietary fiber be a carbohydrate -lrb- or a polysaccharide -rrb- that be incompletely absorb in human and in some animal .like all carbohydrate , when it be metabolize it can produce four calorie -lrb- kilocalory -rrb- of energy per gram .but in most circumstance it account for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility .	dietary fiber usually produce less than four calorie .
while `` radius '' normally be a characteristic of perfect sphere , the term as use in this article more generally mean the distance from some `` center '' of the Earth to a point on the surface or on a idealized surface that model the Earth .it can also mean some kind of average of such distance , or of the radius of a sphere whose curvature match the curvature of the ellipsoidal model of the Earth at a give point .	in this article , by earth 's radius we mean the average distance from the center to the surface of the earth or a sphere with the same curvature .
in asexual reproduction , a individual can reproduce without involvement with another individual of that species .the division of a bacterial cell into two daughter cell be a example of asexual reproduction .asexual reproduction be not , however , limit to single-celled organism .most plant have the ability to reproduce asexually and the ant species Mycocepurus smithius be think to reproduce entirely by asexual means .	another constraint on switching from sexual to asexual reproduction would be the concomitant loss of meiosis and the protective recombinational repair of dna damage afford as one function of meiosis .
a heritage tree be typically a large , individual tree with unique value , which be consider irreplaceable .the major criterion for heritage tree designation be age , rarity , and size , as well as aesthetic , botanical , ecological , and historical value .Heritage tree ordinance be develop to place limit upon the removal of these tree ; the ordinance be orient towards a specific tree , not a woodland .Heritage tree in Singapore be protect by law under the Heritage Trees Scheme adopt on 17 August 2001 .the oak be depict as England 's heritage tree .	unlike woodland protection law , heritage tree ordinance be design limit removal or destruction of specific tree .
a woman need artificial insemination to achieve pregnancy can obtain a sperm sample from she male partner or sperm from sperm donation may be use if , for example , the woman 's partner produce too few motile sperm , or if he carry a genetic disorder , or if the woman have no male partner .sperm be usually obtain through masturbation or the use of a electrical stimulator , although a special condom , know as a collection condom , may be use to collect the semen during intercourse .	artificial insemination can help conception if the woman have a sperm allergy or if the man have reproductive difficulty such as a low sperm count or poor sperm motility .
many variation of the monoamine hypothesis involve the neurotransmitter serotonin , regulate by the serotonin transporter , which assist the modulation of feeling and behavior such as anxiety , anger , appetite , sexuality , sleep , mood , etc. .people with depression may have difference in serotonin transporter gene length .people with both allele that be long be less likely to become depressed , while people with one short and one long or two short allele be more likely to develop depression .	serotonin transponder assist in modulate feeling and behavior -lrb- e.g. , anxiety , hunger , sleep -rrb- and abnormality in the gene length responsible for serotonin have be show to be associate with depression .
Zipf 's law state that give some corpus of natural language utterance , the frequency of any word be inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table .thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word , three time as often as the third most frequent word , etc. .for example , in the brown Corpus of American English text , the word `` the '' be the most frequently occur word , and by itself account for nearly 7 % of all word occurrence -lrb- 69,971 out of slightly over 1 million -rrb- .	the word `` the '' be the most frequently occur word in English , and account for nearly 7 % of all word occurrence in the brown Corpus of American English text .
it be rightly assume from the start of the Framingham Heart Study that cardiac health can be influence by lifestyle and environmental factor , and by inheritance .the Framingham Heart Study be the origin of the term risk factor .before the Framingham Heart Study , doctor have little sense of prevention .in the 1950s , it be believe that clog of artery and narrowing of artery -lrb- atherosclerosis , arteriosclerosis -rrb- be a normal part of aging and occur universally as people become older .high blood pressure -lrb- hypertension -rrb- and elevated serum cholesterol -lrb- hypercholesterolemia -rrb- be also see as normal consequence of aging in the 1950s , and no treatment be initiate .these and further risk factor , e.g. , homocysteine , be gradually discover over the year .	the orbit of Earth trojan could make they less energetically costly to reach than the Moon , even though they be hundred of time more distant .
although the Blu-ray Disc specification have be finalize , engineer continue to work on advance the technology .by 2005 , quad-layer -lrb- 128 gb -rrb- disc have be demonstrate on a drive with modify optics and standard unaltered optics .Hitachi state that such a disc could be use to store 7 hour of 32 mbit/s video -lrb- hdtv -rrb- or 3 hour and 30 minute of 64 mbit/s video -lrb- Cinema 4k -rrb- .in August 2006 , TDK announce that they have create a work experimental blu-ray Disc capable of hold 200 gb of datum on a single side , use six 33 gb datum layer .	Bluray , despite have its specification finalize , be still a active field of research where company such as Hitachi and TDK have achieve significantly higher capacity disc in recent year .
a alternate theory of derive the meaning of a newly learn word by young child during language acquisition stem from John Locke 's `` associative proposal theory '' .compare to the `` intentional proposal theory '' , associative proposal theory refer to the deduction of meaning by compare the novel object to environmental stimulus .a study conduct by Yu & Ballard -lrb- 2007 -rrb- , introduce cross-situational learning , a method base on Locke 's theory .cross-situtational learning theory be a mechanism in which the child learn meaning of word over multiple exposure in vary context in attempt eliminate uncertainty of the word 's true meaning on a exposure-by-exposure basis .	a study conduct by Yu & Ballard -lrb- 2007 -rrb- , introduce cross-situational learning base on the theory that a child learn word meaning through multiple exposure in different setting in order to remove uncertainty of a word 's true meaning on a exposure-by-exposure basis .
Social deficit distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorder -lrb- asd ; see classification -rrb- from other developmental disorder .people with autism have social impairment and often lack the intuition about other that many people take for grant .note autistic Temple Grandin describe she inability to understand the social communication of neurotypical , or people with normal neural development , as leave she feeling `` like a anthropologist on Mars '' .	autism be characterize by social impairment , i.e. , the inability to understand the social communication of neurotypical .
the electrical resistivity of a metallic conductor decrease gradually as temperature be lower and at the same time its conductivity become infinite .thus a current in a superconductor flow without any change in magnitude .in ordinary conductor , such as copper or silver , this decrease be limit by impurity and other defect .even near absolute zero , a real sample of a normal conductor show some resistance .	magnetic field be produce by move electric charge and the intrinsic magnetic moment of elementary particle associate with a fundamental quantum property , they spin .
in biodiversity study , the checkerboard score or c-score be a statistic which determine the randomness of the distribution of two or more species through a collection of biome .the statistic , first publish by Stone and Roberts in 1990 , expand on the earlier work of Diamond that define a notion of `` checkerboard distribution '' as a indicator of species competition .	First publish by Stone and Roberts in 1990 , the checkerboard score extend statistics in earlier biodiversity research to reflect the randomness of the distribution of two or more species through a set of biome .
submarine channel and they flanking levee be commonly refer to as channel levee system -lrb- Flood and Damuth , 1987 -rrb- .they be significant geomorphological feature that may run for thousand of kilometre across the ocean floor .often , they coalesce and overlap to form channel levee complex which be the building block of many major submarine fan .-lrb- Kane , 2010 -rrb- this make they one of several geological process responsible for the transport of coarse grained sediment into deep water as well as be a chief conduit for the transfer of carbon from continental shelf to the deeper part of the continental margin .-lrb- Bull et al. , 2009 ; Frey - Martinez et al. , 2005 ; Gee et al. , 2006 ; Masson et al. , 2006 ; Shipp et al. , 2004 -rrb- .	submarine channel be one of the reason for the transportation of sediment into deep water .
the concept of create machine that can operate autonomously date back to classical time , but research into the functionality and potential use of robot do not grow substantially until the 20th century .throughout history , robotic have be often see to mimic human behavior , and often manage task in a similar fashion .	the first electronic scanning format , 405 line , be the first `` high definition '' television system , since the mechanical system it replace have far fewer .
adaptation to weightlessness involve not just the sensory-motor coupling function , but some autonomic nervous system function as well .sleep disorder and orthostatic intolerance be also common during and after spaceflight .there be no hydrostatic pressure in a weightless environment .as a result , the redistribution of body fluid toward the upper body cause a decrease in leg volume , which may affect muscle viscosity and compliance .	a spaceflight typically begin with a rocket launch , which provide the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propel the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth .
most avian brood parasite will remove a host egg when they lay one of they own in a nest .depend upon the species , this can happen either in the same visit to the host nest or in a separate visit before or after the parasitism .this both prevent the host species from realize they nest have be parasitize and reduce competition for the parasitic nestling once it hatch .	to prevent the host species from detect parasite egg , avian brood parasite will replace the original egg with they own , keep the same number at all time .
heat flux or thermal flux be the rate of heat energy transfer through a give surface .the SI derive unit of heat rate be joule per second , or watt .heat flux be the heat rate per unit area .in SI unit , heat flux be measure in w/m2 .heat rate be a scalar quantity , while heat flux be a vectorial quantity .to define the heat flux at a certain point in space , one take the limit case where the size of the surface become infinitesimally small .	heat flux be the vectorial analog of the scalar heat rate , whereas heat rate be joule per second , heat flux be the heat rate per unit area , measure in w/m2 .
Iron oxide and oxide-hydroxide be widespread in nature , play a important role in many geological and biological process , and be widely utilize by human , e.g. , as iron ore , pigment , catalyst , in thermite -lrb- see the diagram -rrb- , hemoglobin .common rust be a form of iron -lrb- iii -rrb- oxide .Iron oxide be widely use as inexpensive , durable pigment in paint , coating and color concrete .color commonly available be in the `` earthy '' end of the yellow/orange/red / brown/black range .	Iron oxide play a important role in biological process in nature and in fact common rust be a type of iron oxide .
the principle of faunal succession , also know as the law of faunal succession , be base on the observation that sedimentary rock stratum contain fossilized flora and fauna , and that these fossil succeed each other vertically in a specific , reliable order that can be identify over wide horizontal distance .a fossilized neanderthal bone will never be find in the same stratum as a fossilized Megalosaurus , for example , because neanderthal and megalosaurus live during different geological period , separate by many million of year .this allow for stratum to be identify and date by the fossil find within .	because fossil appear in a specific , vertical order in geological stratum , the principle of faunal succession state that the reliable vertical order can be use to reliably date fossil , show for example that a fossilized megalosaurus and neanderthal bone will never be find in the same stratum because the two live during different geological period .
Historically , species have be classify into the binary category of vocal learner or vocal non-learner base on they ability to produce novel vocalization or imitate other species , with evidence from social isolation , deafening study , and cross-fostering experiment .however , vocal learner exhibit a great deal of plasticity or variation between species , result in a spectrum of ability .the vocalization of songbird and whale have a syntactic-like organization similar to that of human but be limit to Finite-State Grammars -lrb- fsg -rrb- , where they can generate string of sequence with limited structural complexity .	although species be typically divide into either vocal learner or non-learner accord to they vocalization and imitation capability , vocal learn show a spectrum of capability , with some species such as song bird use limited syntactic construction to produce vocal sequence with some structural complexity .
as the ratio pyrometer come into popular use , it be determine that many material , of which metal be a example , do not have the same emissivity at two wavelength .for these material , the emissivity do not cancel out and the temperature measurement be in error .the amount of error depend on the emissivity and the wavelength where the measurement be take .	the ratio pyrometer reveal that many material do not have the same emissivity at two wavelength , which cause error in the temperature measurement .
the area be first settle in the 19th century , by mostly irish immigrant .the place may have be name after a prominent settler family , as religious record indicate the death of a certain Richard Shannon in 1831 and Simon Shannon the next year .further impetus to its development come around 1850 when the timber industry begin and in 1860 when a sawmill be build .around 1861 , about two third of the population be irish , and by 1900 , half the population .	the near side of the Moon be characterise by large dark area that be believe to be sea by the astronomer who first map they .
not all modern notion of spirituality embrace transcendental idea .secular spirituality emphasize humanistic idea on moral character -lrb- quality such as love , compassion , patience , tolerance , forgiveness , contentment , responsibility , harmony , and a concern for other -rrb- .these be aspect of life and human experience which go beyond a purely materialist view of the world without necessarily accept belief in a supernatural reality or divine being .	the concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition be unknown to early player of musical instrument .
Benthos be the organism which live in the benthic zone , and be different from those elsewhere in the water column .many be adapt to live on the substrate -lrb- bottom -rrb- .in they habitat they can be consider as dominant creature , but they be often a source of prey for Carcharhinidae such as the lemon shark .many organism adapt to deep-water pressure can not survive in the upper part of the water column .the pressure difference can be very significant -lrb- approximately one atmosphere for each 10 meter of water depth -rrb- .	organism which live in the benthic zone of the ocean be call bentho , the dominant creature in they habitat which be the main prey for carcharhinida .
although its use be vital to cross the ocean , the Marine glass be not such a accurate instrument to measure the passage of time .many factor could affect the duration of sand 's flow : the humidity inside the `` glass '' , the uniformity in fineness of the sand , the inner diameter of the connect tube with a possible wear cause by the flow of sand , the more or less horizontal position , the effect of acceleration or deceleration of the ship 's movement , all could influence the flow of sand and hence the time measure .	Maars be shallow , flat-floored crater that scientist interpret as have form above diatreme as a result of a violent expansion of magmatic gas or steam ; deep erosion of a maar presumably would expose a diatreme .
the ring of fire be a direct result of plate tectonic and the movement and collision of lithospheric plate .the eastern section of the ring be the result of the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate be subduct beneath the westward move South American Plate .the Cocos Plate be be subduct beneath the Caribbean Plate , in Central America .	the volcanic activity surround the Pacific , know as the ring of fire , be due to plate techtonic in the lithosphere where the in the east , the Nazca and Cocos plate be be subduct by the South American and Caribbean plate .
a certain amount of land will inevitably be lose in this process while beach be be build up result in settlement , farmland and other property be destroy .because of this , manage retreat be often not a socially acceptable plan and may invoke the need for compensation to land-owner .intertidal site be often a rich archaeological resource and the loss of heritage be a factor to be weigh in manage retreat project .	though manage retreat often create rich archaeological resource , the process do involve a loss of land , which can cause property destruction and possibly as a result , require monetary compensation to the owner .
in appropriate context , diatomic carbon can be view either as ethyne with two hydrogen atom remove , ethene with four hydrogen remove , or as ethane with six hydrogen remove ; and as such , ethynylidene , ethenediylidene , or ethanetriylidene , respectively , may be use as context-specific systematic name , accord to substitutive nomenclature .	Valence bond theory predict a quadruple bond as the only way to satisfy the octet rule for carbon .
a visual binary star be a binary star for which the angular separation between the two component be great enough to permit they to be observe as a double star in a telescope , or even high-powered binoculars .the angular resolution of the telescope be a important factor in the detection of visual binary , and as better angular resolution be apply to binary star observation increase number of visual binary will be detect .the relative brightness of the two star be also a important factor , as glare from a bright star may make it difficult to detect the presence of a fainter component .	a binary star be consider as a visual binary if its star have relatively similar brightness and enough angular separation that can permit a observer to resolve they within a normal telescope .
fish measurement be the measuring of the length of individual fish and of various part of they anatomy .these datum be use in many area of ichthyology , include taxonomy and fishery biology .	fish measurement be nothing but the process of measure the dimension of different part of a fish .
in UIT , ultrasonic wave be produce by a electro-mechanical ultrasonic transducer , and apply to a workpiece .a acoustically tune resonator bar be cause to vibrate by energize it with a magnetostrictive ultrasonic transducer .the energy generate from these high frequency impulse be impart to the treat surface through the contact of specially design steel pin .these transfer pin be free to move axially between the resonant body and the treat surface .	ultrasonic impact treatment use ultrasonic wave produce by a electro-mechanical ultrasonic transducer , which be apply to the treatment surface use metal pin .
in addition to the general purpose , the study be design to gather information to test specific hypothesis concern demographic and socioeconomic differential in fertility , the prevalence of contraceptive practice and the method employ , the extent to which subfecundity and sterility may have contribute to low fertility , and the timing pattern and childbearing pace of the time .the interview collect information on each respondent 's family planning , contraception usage , pregnancy history , fecundity , infertility , fertility , and maternal and infant health .besides demographic characteristic and background information about the respondent , information be also gather on they household composition , they husband -lrb- s -rrb- , marriage , and area of residency .	the simultaneous oscillation can be call plasmon hybridization where the tunability of the oscillation be associate with mixture of the inner and outer shell where they hybridize to give a lower energy or higher energy .
for skin prick test , a tiny board with protrude needle be use .the allergen be place either on the board or directly on the skin .the board be then place on the skin , in order to puncture the skin and for the allergen to enter the body .if a hive appear , the person will be consider positive for the allergy .this test only work for ige antibody .allergic reaction cause by other antibody can not be detect through skin prick test .	skin prick test can not be use for non-ige antibody .
water body be often affect by geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol , affect the flavour of water for drinking and of fish grow in that water .haloanisole similarly affect water body , and be a recognise cause of off-flavour in wine .cow grazing on weed such as wild garlic can produce a ` weedy ' off-flavour in milk .	the flavour of water and wine can be affect by Haloanisoles .
for very precise work the ph meter should be calibrate before each measurement .for normal use calibration should be perform at the beginning of each day .the reason for this be that the glass electrode do not give a reproducible e.m.f. over longer period of time .calibration should be perform with at least two standard buffer solution that span the range of ph value to be measure .for general purpose buffer at ph 4.01 and ph 10.00 be acceptable .	the calibration of the ph meter should be do every morning .
the causal effect of a treatment on a single unit at a point in time be the difference between the outcome variable with the treatment and without the treatment .the fundamental Problem of Causal Inference be that it be impossible to observe the causal effect on a single unit .you either take the aspirin now or you do not .as a consequence , assumption must be make in order to estimate the miss counterfactual .	Engine be originally a term for any mechanical device that convert force into motion .
one caveat to this calculation be that the original work be concern with the hydrography of the East China Sea , where cooling play the dominant role in the formation of dense shelf water , and that this mechanism may not apply in other region .however , it have be suggest that other process may drive the pump under different climatic condition .for instance , in polar region , the formation of sea-ice result in the extrusion of salt that may increase seawater density .similarly , in tropical region , evaporation may increase local salinity and seawater density .	the continental shelf pump be cause my varied oceanic , such as near the pole where the sea-ice formation result in the extrusion of salt that may increase seawater density .
researcher in Japan have successfully regrown fully functional tooth in mouse .epithelial and mesenchymal cell be extract from the mouse , culture to produce a tooth `` germ '' , and the germ be then implant into the bone at the space of a miss tooth .a tooth of the correct external and internal structure , hardness , strength , and sensitivity later erupt in the space , eventually meet the oppose tooth in a manner similar to a original natural tooth .this technique may be a possible future treatment for replacement of miss tooth .	the development , appearance , and classification of tooth fall within its field of study , though dental occlusion , or contact among tooth , do not .
Baby talk and imitation of it may be use by one noninfant to another as a form of verbal abuse , in which the talk be intend to infantilize the victim .this can occur during bullying , when the bully use baby talk to assert that the victim be weak , cowardly , overemotional , or otherwise submissive .	Baby talk may be use as a form of flirtation between sexual or romantic partner .
in the field of energetic , a energy carrier correspond only to a energy form -lrb- not a energy system -rrb- of energy input require by the various sector of society to perform they function .Energy carrier -lrb- ec -rrb- be produce by the energy sector use primary energy source -lrb- pe -rrb- .the distinction between `` Energy Carriers '' and `` primary energy source '' be extremely important since these two label refer to energy form of different quality so that they can not be aggregate : 1 megajoule -lrb- mj -rrb- of ec be not the same as 1 mj of pe .	beryllium-containing alloy create a inhalation hazard during manufacturing due to they toxic property .
anatomically , the cerebellum have the appearance of a separate structure attach to the bottom of the brain , tuck underneath the cerebral hemisphere .its surface be cover with finely space parallel groove , in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolution of the cerebral cortex .these parallel groove conceal the fact that the cerebellum be actually a continuous thin layer of tissue -lrb- the cerebellar cortex -rrb- , tightly fold in the style of a accordion .within this thin layer be several type of neuron with a highly regular arrangement , the most important be purkinje cell and granule cell .	the brainstem provide the main motor and sensory innervation to the face and neck via the cranial nerve .
if there be any particle suspend in the water , they will increase the scattering of light .in coastal area , runoff from river , resuspension of sand and silt from the bottom by tide , wave and storm and a number of other substance can change the color of the near-shore water .some type of particle can also contain substance that absorb certain wavelength of light , which alter its characteristic .	particle naturally suspend in water source can change the color of coastline water .
structured observation represent a compromise between the passive nonintervention of naturalistic observation , and the systematic manipulation of independent variable and precise control characterize by lab experiment .structured observation may occur in a natural or laboratory setting .within structured observation , often the observer intervene in order to cause a event to occur , or to `` set up '' a situation so that event can be more easily record than they would be without intervention .such a situation often make use of a confederate who create a situation for observe behavior .structured observation be frequently employ by clinical and developmental psychologist , or for study animal in the wild .one benefit to structured observation be that it allow researcher to record behavior that may be difficult to observe use naturalistic observation , but that be more natural than the artificial condition impose in a lab .however , problem in interpret structured observation can occur when the same observation procedure be not follow across observation or observer , or when important variable be not control across observation .	the word `` viscosity '' be derive from the Latin `` viscum '' , mean `` anything sticky , birdlime make from mistletoe , mistletoe '' .
cancer cluster suspicion usually arise when member of the general public report that they family member , friend , neighbor , or coworker have be diagnose with the same or related cancer .state or local health department will investigate the possibility of a cancer cluster when a claim be file .in order to justify investigate such claim , health department conduct a preliminary review .datum will be collect and verify regard : the type of cancer report , number of case , geographic area of the case , and the patient clinical history .at this point , a committee of medical professional will examine the datum and determine whether or not a investigation -lrb- often lengthy and expensive -rrb- be justified .	the exact component of fan will vary from composition of the wort or grape must .
Ridley examine the history of different attempt which have be make to explain the fact that human in society do not defect , look at various computer generate model which have be use to explain how such behaviour could arise .in particular he look at system base on the idea of Tit-for-Tat , where member of the group only cooperate with those who also cooperate and exclude those who do not .this allow altruistic behaviour to develop , and cause the optimum solution to the dilemma , to no longer be to defect but instead to cooperate .	Sociobiology investigate social behavior , such as mating pattern , territorial fight , pack hunting , and the hive society of social insect .
erupt volcano can pose many hazard , not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption .volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft , in particular those with jet engine where ash particle can be melt by the high operating temperature ; the melted particle then adhere to the turbine blade and alter they shape , disrupt the operation of the turbine .	the internet , and consequently its backbone network , do not rely on central control or coordinate facility , nor do they implement any global network policy .
in human , mature sexual desire usually begin to appear with the onset of puberty .sexual expression can take the form of masturbation or sex with a partner .sexual interest among adolescent , as among adult , can vary greatly .sexual activity in general be associate with various risk include unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease include hiv/aids .the risk be elevated for young adolescent because they brain be not neurally mature ; several brain region in the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex and in the hypothalamus important for self-control , delay gratification , and risk analysis and appreciation be not fully mature .	self-control be essential in behavior to achieve goal and to avoid impulse and/or emotion that could prove to be negative .
the God gene hypothesis be base on a combination of behavioral genetic , neurobiological and psychological study .the major argument of the hypothesis be : -lrb- 1 -rrb- spirituality can be quantify by psychometric measurement ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the underlie tendency to spirituality be partially heritable ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- part of this heritability can be attribute to the gene vmat2 ; -lrb- 4 -rrb- this gene act by alter monoamine level ; and -lrb- 5 -rrb- spiritual individual be favor by natural selection because they be provide with a innate sense of optimism , the latter produce positive effect at either a physical or psychological level .	although it be always difficult to determine the many interact function of a gene , vmat2 appear to be involve in the transport of monoamine neurotransmitter across the synaps of the brain .
Scientology teach that people be immortal being who have forget they true nature .its method of spiritual rehabilitation be a type of counsel know as auditing , in which practitioner aim to consciously re-experience painful or traumatic event in they past in order to free themselves of they limit effect .Study material and auditing course be make available to member in return for specify donation .Scientology be legally recognize as a tax-exempt organization in the United States and some other country , and the Church of Scientology emphasize this as proof that it be a bona fide religion .in other country , notably France , Germany and the United Kingdom , Scientology do not have comparable religious status .	station usually have staff ticket sale office , automate ticket machine , or both , although on some line ticket be sell on board the train .
vaccine do not guarantee complete protection from a disease .sometimes , this be because the host 's immune system simply do not respond adequately or at all .this may be due to a lowered immunity in general -lrb- diabetes , steroid use , hiv infection , age -rrb- or because the host 's immune system do not have a b cell capable of generate antibody to that antigen .	vaccine can be ineffective in case of weak immune system or lack of b cell .
Osmond iron be make by melt pig iron in a hearth that be narrower and deeper than a typical finery in a english finery forge .the hearth have a charcoal fire blow with bellows through a tuyere .as the iron melt , the drop fall though the blast and congeal .they be then lift with a iron bar into the blast .as they melt they be catch on the end of a large staff , hold in the fire and turn rapidly so that the drop spread out , form a ball .	Osmond iron be make by melt pig iron in a hearth heat by a charcoal fire and when melt , catch on the end of a large staff , hold in the fire and turn rapidly to form a sphere .
there be many different type of personality test .the most common type be the self-report inventory , also commonly refer to as objective personality test .self-report inventory test involve the administration of many questions/items to test-taker who respond by rating the degree to which each item reflect they behaviour and can be score objectively .the term ` item ' be use because many test question be not actually question ; they be typically statement on questionnaire that allow respondent to indicate level of agreement -lrb- use a likert scale or , more accurately , a likert-type scale -rrb- .	the first personality test be develop in 1920s and be intend to ease the process of personnel selection , particularly in the armed force .
evolutionary biology , as a academic discipline in its own right , emerge during the period of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930 and 1940 .it be not until the 1970s and 1980s , however , that a significant number of university have department that specifically include the term evolutionary biology in they title , often in conjuction with ecology and behavior .	Charles Darwin be the first to formulate a scientific argument for the theory of evolution by means of natural selection .
there be several test for polysemy , but one of they be zeugma : if one word seem to exhibit zeugma when apply in different context , it be likely that the context bring out different polyseme of the same word .if the two sens of the same word do not seem to fit , yet seem related , then it be likely that they be polysemous .the fact that this test again depend on speaker ' judgment about relatedness , however , mean that this test for polysemy be not infallible , but be rather merely a helpful conceptual aid .	test for polysemy often rely on speaker ' relatedness judgment , which also mean that certain test for polysemy - though helpful - can be wrong due to factor such as fluency and background knowledge .
a typical parser generator associate executable code with each of the rule of the grammar that should be execute when these rule be apply by the parser .these piece of code be sometimes refer to as semantic action routine since they define the semantics of the syntactic structure that be analyze by the parser .depend upon the type of parser that should be generate , these routine may construct a parse tree -lrb- or abstract syntax tree -rrb- , or generate executable code directly .	one of the earliest -lrb- 1964 -rrb- , surprisingly powerful , version of compiler-compiler be meta ii , which accept grammar and code generation rule , and be able to compile itself and other language .
cmo be also sometimes refer to as complementary-symmetry metal -- oxide -- semiconductor -lrb- or cos-mo -rrb- .the word `` complementary-symmetry '' refer to the fact that the typical digital design style with cmo use complementary and symmetrical pair of p-type and n-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor -lrb- mosfet -rrb- for logic function .	radium , in the form of radium chloride , be discover by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie in 1898 .
the eutectoid composition of austenite be approximately 0.76 % carbon ; steel with less carbon content will contain a corresponding proportion of relatively pure ferrite crystallite that do not participate in the eutectoid reaction and can not transform into pearlite .likewise steel with higher carbon contents will form cementite before reach the eutectoid point .the proportion of ferrite and cementite form above the eutectoid point can be calculate from the iron/iron -- carbide equilibrium phase diagram use the lever rule .	austenite contain less than one percent carbon but steel with less carbon content will contain a corresponding proportion of relatively pure ferrite crystallite that can not transform into pearlite .
Cabin fever be a idiomatic term , first record in 1918 , for a claustrophobic reaction that take place when a person or group be isolate and/or shut in a small space , with nothing to do for a extended period .Cabin fever describe the extreme irritability and restlessness a person may feel in these situation .a person may experience cabin fever in a situation such as be in a simple country vacation cottage .when experience cabin fever , a person may tend to sleep , have distrust of anyone they be with , and a urge to go outside even in the rain , snow , dark or hail .the phrase be also use humorously to indicate simple boredom from be home alone .	claustrophobia be typically classify as a anxiety disorder and often result in panic attack , and can be the result of many situation or stimulus , include elevator crowd to capacity , windowless room , and even tight-necked clothing .
Tongoa and Epi island once form part of a larger island call Kuwae .local folklore tell of a cataclysmic eruption that destroy this island , leave the two smaller island and a oval-shaped 12 x 6 km caldera in between -lrb- but the story tell of a eruption south of Tongoa -rrb- .collapse associate with caldera formation may have be as much as 1,100 metre .around 32 -- 39 cubic km of magma be erupt , make the Kuwae eruption one of the largest in the last 10,000 year .	kuwae eruption be massive and cause a caldera of 6 km .
Astrology have be reject by the scientific community as have no explanatory power for describe the universe -lrb- see pseudoscience -rrb- .Scientific testing of astrology have be conduct , and no evidence have be find to support any of the premise or purported effect outline in astrological tradition .where astrology have make falsifiable prediction , it have be falsify .there be no proposed mechanism of action by which the position and motion of star and planet could affect people and event on Earth that do not contradict well understand , basic aspect of biology and physics .	Reuben 's next release , Hindsight -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , continue he use of a wide variety of musical genre and thoughtful , often funny lyric .
collide galaxy be common in galaxy evolution .due to the extremely tenuous distribution of matter in galaxy , these be not collision in the normal sense of the word , but rather gravitational interaction .collide may lead to merge .this occur when two galaxy collide and do not have enough momentum to continue travel after the collision .instead , they fall back into each other and eventually merge after many pass through each other , form one galaxy .if one of the collide galaxy be much larger than the other , it will remain largely intact after the merger ; that be , the larger galaxy will look much the same while the smaller galaxy will be strip apart and become part of the larger galaxy .	after the collision of two galaxy if they do not have enough momentum to continue travel , a galaxy merge take place result in a single galaxy which usually look very similar to the larger of the two collide galaxy if it be significantly bigger in dimension .
in 2000-2001 a second cohort be establish -lrb- rs-ii -rrb- .another 3,011 inhabitant of ommoord aged 55 year and over agree to participate .the participant of this second cohort visit the research center for a follow-up examination in 2004-2005 and 2011-2012 .	the change in rotational period of the neutron star come from the transition region between the magnetosphere and the plasma flow from the companion star .
unlike semantics , which examine meaning that be conventional or `` code '' in a give language , pragmatic study how the transmission of meaning depend not only on structural and linguistic knowledge -lrb- e.g. , grammar , lexicon , etc. -rrb- of the speaker and listener , but also on the context of the utterance , any pre-existing knowledge about those involve , the infer intent of the speaker , and other factor .in this respect , pragmatic explain how language user be able to overcome apparent ambiguity , since mean rely on the manner , place , time etc. of a utterance .	in pragmatic , there be two different type of mean to consider : semantico-referential meaning and indexical meaning .
a satellite be a subviral agent compose of nucleic acid that depend on the co-infection of a host cell with a helper or master virus for its multiplication .when a satellite encode the coat protein in which its nucleic acid be encapsidate it be refer to as a satellite virus .a satellite virus of mamavirus that inhibit the replication of its host have be term a virophage .however , the usage of this term remain controversial due to the lack of fundamental difference between virophage and classical satellite virus .	a satellite virus in biology be a subviral agent make of nucleic acid which encode the coat protein in which its nucleic acid be encapsidate .
usually the purpose behind watercraft design and skill be for seafare education or leisure activity , fishing and resource extraction , transportation of cargo or passenger , and for conduct combat or salvage operation .in general , the purpose of a water vehicle identify its utility with a maritime industry sub-sector .	city and town usually have legal restriction on where bar may be located and on the type of alcohol they may serve to they customer .
linguistics have make considerable advance in the half-century since Korais ' time .the decipherment of ancient write system , the publication of Grimm 's law of sound-change in 1822 , Bopp 's trace of the inter-relationship of the indo-european language , Diez 's work on the development of the romance language from Vulgar Latin , Schleicher 's demonstration of a evolutionary tree of language , and finally the announcement of Verner 's law in 1875 , have all make it clear that the change a language undergo as time pass be not simply accumulation of random damage , like copying error in a manuscript .	linguistic development have show that language evolve and grow in common way , rather than change due to seemingly random error -lrb- such as be find in manuscript copy -rrb- as earlier theorist suggest .
fossil beach may be discover where a limestone quarry or strip mining operation be present .for example , Miami have numerous fossil beach which have be expose by limestone mining .a famous example be the Pinecrest bed -- a fossil-bearing rock formation find in the south of the city which be a segment of a much larger geological formation -- the Tamiami formation .	fossil beach be usually find as a result of mining operation such as Miami limestone mining or Pinecrest bed .
debris flow have volumetric sediment concentration exceed about 40 to 50 % , and the remainder of a flow 's volume consist of water .by definition , `` debris '' include sediment grain with diverse shape and size , commonly range from microscopic clay particle to great boulder .Media report often use the term mudflow to describe debris flow , but true mudflow be compose mostly of grain smaller than sand .on Earth 's land surface , mudflow be far less common than debris flow .however , underwater mudflow be prevalent on submarine continental margin , where they may spawn turbidity current .	debris flow can be trigger by intense rainfall or snowmelt , by dam-break or glacial outburst flood , or by landslide that may or may not be associate with intense rain .
allergic reaction to fruit and vegetable be usually mild and often just affect the mouth , cause itching , a rash , or blister where the food touch the lip and mouth .this be call oral allergy syndrome .-lrb- a number of people who react in this way to fruit or vegetable will also react to pollen from some tree and weed .so , for example , people who be allergic to birch pollen be also likely to be allergic to apple . -rrb-another symptom may include slight swell in the throat , make it feel like it be close .the ability to breathe be still present though , so it be not fatal .	the oral allergy syndrome , that sometimes cause swell in the throat , can be trigger by fruit , pollen from tree or weed .
generative linguist think that for native speaker of natural language , grammaticality be a matter of linguistic intuition , a competence learn by language acquisition in childhood .therefore , generative linguistics strive to predict grammaticality exhaustively .on the other hand , there be a gradual abandonment of grammaticality in favour of acceptability by linguist that stress the social acquisition of language in contrast to innate factor -lrb- and who will seldom rely on phrase structure grammar -rrb- in the tradition of Hopper 1987 .	prescriptive grammar of controlled natural language define grammaticality as a matter of explicit consensus .
a hydrometer be usually make of glass and consist of a cylindrical stem and a bulb weight with mercury or lead shot to make it float upright .the liquid to be test be pour into a tall container , often a graduate cylinder , and the hydrometer be gently lower into the liquid until it float freely .the point at which the surface of the liquid touch the stem of the hydrometer be note .hydrometer usually contain a scale inside the stem , so that the specific gravity can be read directly .a variety of scale exist , and be use depend on the context .	a hydrometer be often make from a glass tube fill with some liquid and a bulb that can be read where it touch the side when free float in order to measure the specific gravity .
IQ score be also use to study IQ distribution in population and the correlation between IQ and other variable .raw score on IQ test for many population have be rise at a average rate that scale to three IQ point per decade since the early 20th century , a phenomenon call the Flynn effect .investigation of differ pattern of increase in IQ battery subtest score inform current research on human intelligence .	among different study that have investigate the correlation of IQ score with other variable , one be the Flynn effect accord to which the average IQ of population grow linearly by time .
by the modern definition , the term binary star be generally restricted to pair of star which revolve around a common centre of mass .binary star which can be resolve with a telescope or interferometric method be know as visual binary .	a binary star , i.e. , two star orbit the same center , be call a visual binary if it can be resolve with a telescope .
human error and performance be two side of the same coin : `` human error '' mechanism be the same as `` human performance '' mechanism ; performance later categorize as ` error ' be do so in hindsight : therefore action later term `` human error '' be actually part of the ordinary spectrum of human behaviour .the study of absent-mindedness in everyday life provide ample documentation and categorization of such aspect of behavior .	a basic example of the hindsight bias be when , after view the outcome of a potentially unforeseeable event , a person believe he or she `` know it all along '' .
if a sheet of glass be place in the tank , the depth of water in the tank will be shallower over the glass than elsewhere .the speed of a wave in water depend on the depth , so the ripple slow down as they pass over the glass .this cause the wavelength to decrease .if the junction between the deep and shallow water be at a angle to the wavefront , the wave will refract .in the diagram above , the wave can be see to bend towards the normal .the normal be show as a dot line .the dash line be the direction that the wave would travel if they have not meet the angled piece of glass .	when directly generate and affect by local wind , a wind wave system be call a wind sea and after the wind cease to blow , wind wave be call swell .
the Internet backbone refer to the principal datum route between large , strategically interconnect network and core router on the internet .these datum route be host by commercial , government , academic and other high-capacity network center , the Internet exchange point and network access point , that interchange internet traffic between the country , continent and across the ocean of the world .	the core of the internet come from strategically-interconnected router , know as the internet backbone , which connect large institution such as university or business that have high-capacity network center .
Sleep as a phenomenon appear to have very old evolutionary root .the nematode c. elegan be the most primitive organism in which sleep-like state have be observe .here , a lethargus phase occur in short period precede each moult , a fact which may indicate that sleep primitively be connect to developmental process .Raizen et al. 's result furthermore suggest that sleep be necessary for change in the neural system .	study show that sleep be a old phenomenon whose root go back to nematode .
the sphenopalatine artery pass through the sphenopalatine foraman into the cavity of the nose , at the back part of the superior meatus .here it give off its posterior lateral nasal branch which spread forward over the conchæ and meatus , anastomose with the ethmoidal artery and the nasal branch of the descend palatine , and assist in supply the frontal , maxillary , ethmoidal , and sphenoidal sinus .	the sphenopalatine artery pass into the cavity of the nose where it give off its posterior lateral nasal branch that spread forward and help to supply the frontal , maxillary , ethmoidal , and sphenoidal sinus .
typical step involve recording , transcribe -lrb- often use the International Phonetic Alphabet and/or a `` practical orthography '' make up for that language -rrb- , annotation and analysis , translation into a language of wider communication , archiving and dissemination .critical to the project of language documentation be the creation of good record in the course of do language description .these material can be archive , though not all archive be equally adept at handle language material preserve in vary technological format , nor be they all equally accessible to potential user .	language documentation be the process by which a language be document from a documentary linguistics perspective .
there be two type of precondition for unsafe act : those that relate to the human operator 's internal state and those that relate to the human operator 's practice or way of work .adverse internal state include those related to physiology -lrb- e.g. , illness -rrb- and mental state -lrb- e.g. , mentally fatigued , distract -rrb- .a third aspect of ` internal state ' be really a mismatch between the operator 's ability and the task demand ; for example , the operator may be unable to make visual judgment or react quickly enough to support the task at hand .	unsafe act have two precondition , those that come from a individual 's state of mind or physiology , and those that come from they habit , practice and way of work .
the Townsend discharge be a gas ionization process where free electron , accelerate by a sufficiently strong electric field , give rise to electrical conduction through a gas by avalanche multiplication cause by the ionization of molecule by ion impact .when the number of free charge drop or the electric field weaken , the phenomenon cease .	the Townsend discharge be the process of electrical conduction through gas as a result of ionization .
accord to the director of the project , the Holometer should be capable of detect fluctuation in the light of a single attometer , meeting or exceed the sensitivity require to detect the smallest unit in the universe call Planck unit .Fermilab state : `` everyone be familiar these day with the blurry and pixelated image , or noisy sound transmission , associate with poor internet bandwidth .	holometer surpass current measure device to record at the scale of the smallest unit , Planck unit .
arborist who climb -lrb- as not all do -rrb- can use a variety of technique to ascend into the tree .the least invasive , and most popular technique use be to ascend on rope .when personal safety be a issue , or the tree be be remove , arborist may use ` spike ' , -lrb- also know as ` gaff ' or ` spur ' -rrb- attach to they chainsaw boot with strap to ascend and work .spikes wound the tree , leave small hole where each step have be .	climb arborist use a variety of technique , from the least invasive involve rope , to the most invasive involve chainsaw boot , though the latter injure the tree and be usually only use in case where the tree be due for removal .
connectivity base clustering be a whole family of method that differ by the way distance be compute .apart from the usual choice of distance function , the user also need to decide on the linkage criterion -lrb- since a cluster consist of multiple object , there be multiple candidate to compute the distance to -rrb- to use .Popular choice be know as single-linkage clustering -lrb- the minimum of object distance -rrb- , complete linkage clustering -lrb- the maximum of object distance -rrb- or upgma -lrb- `` Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean '' , also know as average linkage clustering -rrb- .	cluster analysis approach that be base on distance function and linkage criterion be call connectivity-based clustering .
accord to the constant velocity hypothesis propose by Jones and Huang -lrb- 1982 -rrb- , perception incorporate a prior expectation for constant speed .therefore , give the temporal interval mark by sequential stimulus , the brain expect spatial interval that would yield constant velocity movement -lrb- i.e. , uniform motion -rrb- .one limitation of this theory , point out by Goldreich -lrb- 2007 -rrb- , be that it do not explain why even two stimulus press in rapid succession against the skin be perceive as closer together the shorter the temporal interval between they be .	the kappa effect appear to depend strongly on phenomenal rather than physical extent because the kappa effect get bigger as stimulus move faster .
today , anthropometry play a important role in industrial design , clothing design , ergonomics and architecture where statistical datum about the distribution of body dimension in the population be use to optimize product .change in life style , nutrition and ethnic composition of population lead to change in the distribution of body dimension -lrb- e.g. the obesity epidemic -rrb- , and require regular update of anthropometric datum collection .	due to change in life style , activity level , and large scale change in body composition , anthropometry still play a current role in all area where the dimension of the human body must be take into account such as ergonomics or clothing design .
World War II however , perhaps mark the most frantic period of weapon development in the history of humanity .massive number of new design and concept be field , and all exist technology be improve between 1939 and 1945 .the most powerful weapon invent during this period be the atomic bomb , however many more weapon influence the world in different way .	the datum that be store within a cache might be value that have be compute earlier or duplicate of original value that be store elsewhere .
the spin of the electron and proton can be in either direction - in the classical analogy they be rotate clockwise or anticlockwise around a give axis .they may have they spin orient in the same direction or in opposite direction .because of magnetic interaction between the particle , a hydrogen atom that have the spin of the electron and proton align in the same direction -lrb- parallel -rrb- have slightly more energy than one where the spin of the electron and proton be in opposite direction -lrb- anti-parallel -rrb- .	electron and proton may spin in either direction -lrb- clockwise or anti-clockwise -rrb- and because of the magnetic interaction between the two , hydrogen atom have both spin in the same direction will have slightly more energy .
situation sampling involve the study of good people of behavior in many different location , and under different circumstance and condition .by sampling different situation , researcher reduce the chance that the result they obtain will be particular to a certain set of circumstance or condition .for this reason , situation sampling significantly increase the external validity of observational finding .furthermore , situation sampling significantly increase the generalizability of finding .compare to when researcher only observe particular type of individual , researcher use situation sampling can increase the diversity of subject within they observe sample .researcher may determine which subject to observe by either select subject systematically -lrb- every 10th student in a cafeteria , for example -rrb- or randomly , with the goal of obtain a representative sample of all subject .	a chemical system be say to be in equilibrium when the quantity of the chemical entity involve do not and can not change in time without the application of a external influence .
the r-value of a material be determine when the material be in a state of saturation such that water will be exude from the compacted test specimen when a 16.8 kn load -lrb- 2.07 mpa -rrb- be apply .since it be not always possible to prepare a test specimen that will exude water at the specify load , it be necessary to test a series of specimen prepare at different moisture contents .	the r-value test measure the response of a compacted sample of soil or aggregate to a vertically apply pressure under specific condition .
the uranium isotope 235u be use as the fuel for nuclear reactor and nuclear weapon .it be the only isotope exist in nature to any appreciable extent that be fissile , that be , fissionable by thermal neutron .the isotope 238u be also important because it absorb neutron to produce a radioactive isotope that subsequently decay to the isotope 239pu -lrb- plutonium -rrb- , which also be fissile .	uranium 235 be the only isotope exist in nature to any appreciable extent that be fissile , and eventually decay to the plutonium 239 , which also be fissile .
Biogeochemistry be the scientific discipline that involve the study of the chemical , physical , geological , and biological process and reaction that govern the composition of the natural environment -lrb- include the biosphere , the cryosphere , the hydrosphere , the pedosphere , the atmosphere , and the lithosphere -rrb- .in particular , biogeochemistry be the study of the cycle of chemical element , such as carbon and nitrogen , and they interaction with and incorporation into live thing transport through earth scale biological system in space through time .the field focus on chemical cycle which be either drive by or have a impact on biological activity .particular emphasis be place on the study of carbon , nitrogen , sulfur , and phosphorus cycle .Biogeochemistry be a system science closely related to system ecology .	Biogeochemistry focus on cycle of chemical element such as carbon and nitrogen and be related to system ecology .
the equivalent term `` awakening '' have also be use in a christian context , namely the great Awakenings , several period of religious revival in american religious history .historian and theologian identify three or four wave of increase religious enthusiasm occur between the early 18th century and the late 19th century .each of these `` great Awakenings '' be characterize by widespread revival lead by evangelical protestant minister , a sharp increase of interest in religion , a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affect , a increase in evangelical church membership , and the formation of new religious movement and denomination .	the geology of the swabian jura be mostly limestone , which form the seab during the jurassic period .
Ecological trap be think to occur when the attractiveness of a habitat increase disproportionately relative to its value for survival and reproduction .the result be preference of falsely attractive habitat and a general avoidance of high-quality but less-attractive habitat .for example , Indigo Buntings typically nest in shrubby habitat or broken forest transition between closed canopy forest and open field .human activity can create ` sharper ' , more abrupt forest edge and bunting prefer to nest along these edge .however , these artificial sharp forest edge also concentrate the movement of predator which predate they nest .in this way , Buntings prefer to nest in highly altered habitat where they nest success be lowest .	in addition to remove carbon dioxide , breathing result in loss of water from the body .
a additional problem with carbon-14 date from archeological site be know as the `` old wood '' problem .it be possible , particularly in dry , desert climate , for organic material such as from dead tree to remain in they natural state for hundred of year before people use they as firewood or building material , after which they become part of the archaeological record .thus date that particular tree do not necessarily indicate when the fire burn or the structure be build .for this reason , many archaeologist prefer to use sample from short-lived plant for radiocarbon date .the development of accelerator mass spectrometry -lrb- am -rrb- date , which allow a date to be obtain from a very small sample , have be very useful in this regard .	carbon-14 date be make problematic for tree in dry climate that can exist for century before be burn -lrb- lead to wrong date -rrb- , so many scientist prefer to date use short-lived plant and use mass spectrometry , which can be do on very small sample .
isostatic depression be the term use by geologist for the sinking of large part of the Earth 's crust into the asthenosphere .the sinking be cause by a heavy weight place on the Earth 's surface .often this be cause by the heavy weight of glacial ice due to continental glaciation , a process in which permanent ice place pressure on the Earth 's crust thereby depress it with its weight .	isostatic depression be cause by a heavy weight place on the Earth 's surface , often due to glacier .
shoulder that exhibit stiffness , secondary to capsular tightness , contribute to contracture and hypertrophy of the tere major .hence , restricted external rotation can encourage adaptive shorten and thicken of the internal rotator of the shoulder principally the tere major and subscapulari .one may speculate that the lateral arm pain present in shoulder dysfunction may be of a nerve origin secondary to adverse neural tension of the radial nerve .the triceps brachius have a potential to entrap the radial nerve in the triangular interval secondary to hypertrophy .the presence of a fibrous arch in the long head and lateral head further complicate the situation .repeated forceful extension see in weight training and sport involve punching may be a precedent to this scenario .the radial nerve be vulnerable as it pass through this space , for all of the reason mention above .	light weight training of the tere major can mitigate the entrapment by strengthen the muscle responsible for interior rotation , though any nerve trauma may take several week to recover from .
Jupiter be primarily compose of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass be helium , although helium only comprise about a tenth of the number of molecule .it may also have a rocky core of heavier element , but like the other gas giant , Jupiter lack a well-defined solid surface .because of its rapid rotation , the planet 's shape be that of a oblate spheroid -lrb- it possess a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator -rrb- .	Jupiter , a giant plant with oblate spheroid shape and no solid surface , have a rocky core while be mainly compose of hydrogen and helium .
froth flotation be practise by mix chemical know as collector with the ore slurry .the collector adsorb onto the surface of the particle of select mineral -lrb- usually the valuable mineral that be target for concentration -rrb- , make these mineral hydrophobic .Air be pass through the slurry in a tank know as a flotation cell .the air be break into tiny bubble by various mechanism -lrb- depend on the design of the flotation cell -rrb- , and the now-hydrophobic mineral attach to the bubble , rise with they to the surface of the flotation cell , where they form a froth .the froth flow over the top edge -lrb- or `` lip '' -rrb- of the flotation cell and form the flotation concentrate .ideally , none of the unwanted mineral particle float , and they remain behind as the flotation tailing .	froth flotation be practise by mix chemical know as collector with the ore slurry .
organism in the intertidal zone be adapt to a environment of harsh extreme .water be available regularly with the tide but vary from fresh with rain to highly saline and dry salt with dry between tidal inundation .the action of wave can dislodge resident in the littoral zone .with the intertidal zone 's high exposure to the sun , the temperature range can be anything from very hot with full sun to near freezing in colder climate .	since the salt and temperature condition in intertidal zone can vary considerably , organism in that zone should be adapt to such variation .
long polyyne chain be say to be inherently unstable in bulk because they can cross-link with each other in a exothermal -lrb- indeed explosive -rrb- reaction .explosion be a real hazard in this area of research .they can be fairly stable , even against moisture and oxygen , if they be end-capped with suitable group inert group -lrb- such as tert-butyl or trifluoromethyl -rrb- rather than hydrogen atom , especially bulky one that can keep the chain apart .in 1995 the preparation of carbyne chain with over 300 carbon be report use this technique .however the report have be contest by a claim that the detect molecule be fullerene-like structure rather than long polyyne .	long polyene chain may explode if put together due to cross-linking between the molecule and therefore researcher must take suitable care to prepare the molecule for transport or experiment use neutralize cap technique .
in present-day academia , the term `` Aryan '' have be replace in most case by the term `` indo-iranian '' and `` indo-european '' , and `` Aryan '' be now mostly limit to its appearance in the term `` Indo-Aryan '' for indic language and they speaker .western notion of a `` aryan race '' rise to prominence in late-19th and early-20th century racialist think , a idea most notably embrace by nazi ideology -lrb- see master race -rrb- .	improvisation can be think of as a `` on the spot '' or `` off the cuff '' spontaneous moment of sudden inventiveness that can just come to mind , body and spirit as a inspiration and no preparation or training be need .
a dark galaxy be a hypothetical galaxy compose of dark matter .dark galaxy receive they name because they have no detectable star and be theoretically invisible .they be not able to generate star because they density of gas be too high .some scientist have theorize that dark galaxy be actually common in the early stage of the universe .originally , these galaxy have trouble create star because of they density , but as time progress galaxy begin to create star .a influential community of scientist conjecture the existence of dark galaxy to support theory base on other well-studied celestial body .there be experimental evidence to support the existence of dark galaxy , although scientist have no conclusive evidence and continue they research .	accord to astronomical theory , dark galaxy , i.e. , highly dense invisible galaxy compose of dark matter , be common in the early stage of the universe and experimental evidence can now support they existence .
overmatching be match for a apparent confounder that actually be a result of the exposure .true confounder be associate with both the exposure and the disease , but if the exposure itself lead to the confounder , or have equal status with it , then stratify by that confounder will also partly stratify by the exposure , result in a obscure relation of the exposure to the disease .overmatch thus cause statistical bias .	control of plant disease be crucial to the reliable production of food , and it provide significant reduction in agricultural use of land , water , fuel and other input .
Morgan be react to interpretation of animal behaviour - specifically the anecdotal approach of George Romanes - that he deem excessively anthropomorphic .the prestige of Lloyd Morgan 's canon partly derive from case he describe where behaviour that might at first seem to involve higher mental process could in fact be explain by simple trial-and-error learning -lrb- what we would now call operant conditioning -rrb- .a famous example be the skilful way in which Morgan 's terrier Tony open the garden gate , easily take by someone see the final behaviour as a insightful act ; Lloyd Morgan , however , have watch and record the series of approximation by which the dog have gradually learn the response , and could demonstrate that no insight be require to explain it .	the skillfulness of Morgan 's study stem from he careful analysis of how seemingly mentally-complex action could in reality be explain in term of operant conditioning , famously illustrate by the case where Morgan 's dog be able to open a gate , but which Morgan be able to demonstrate be due to the dog 's learning after many case of trial and error .
there be two subcategory : insoluble and soluble fiber .insoluble dietary fiber consist mainly of cellulose , a large carbohydrate polymer that be indigestible by human who do not have the require enzyme to disassemble it nor do they digestive system harbor sufficient quantity of the type of microbe that can do so either .soluble dietary fiber comprise a variety of oligosaccharide , wax , ester , resistant starch and other carbohydrate that dissolve or gelatinize in water .	insoluble and soluble type of fiber mainly contain cellulose abd oligosaccharide respectively .
a micrometeorite be a extraterrestrial particle , range in size from 50 µm to 2 mm , collect on the Earth 's surface .micrometeorite be micrometeoroid which have survive entry through the Earth 's atmosphere .they differ from meteorite in be smaller , more plentiful and different in composition and be a subset of cosmic dust , which also include the smaller interplanetary dust particle -lrb- idp -rrb- .Fred Lawrence Whipple first coin the term `` micro-meteorite '' to describe dust-sized object that fall to the Earth .	micrometeoroid of size from 50 µm to 2 mm which can reach the Earth 's surface be refer to as micrometeorite , extraterrestrial particle which be smaller .
most country of the world operate fleet of merchant ship .however , due to the high cost of operation , today these fleet be in many case sail under the flag of nation that specialize in provide manpower and service at favourable term .such flag be know as `` flag of convenience '' .currently , Liberia and Panama be particularly favour .ownership of the vessel can be by any country , however .	during war , merchant ship may be use as auxiliary to the navy of they respective country , and be call upon to deliver military personnel and material .
audiogram in human be produce use a audiometer , which present different frequency to the subject , usually over calibrate headphone , at specify level .the level be weight with frequency relative to a standard graph know as the minimum audibility curve , which be intend to represent `` normal '' hearing .the threshold of hearing be set at around 0 phon on the equal-loudness contour , but be standardise in a ANSI standard to 1 khz .there be several of the minimal audibility curve , define in different international standard ; different audiometer thus give rise to difference in audiogram .the asa-1951 standard , for example , use a level of 16.5 db spl -lrb- sound pressure level -rrb- at 1 khz , whereas the later ansi-1969 / iso-1963 standard use 6.5 db spl.a 10 db correction be allow for older people .	a audiometer produce human audiogram by play different frequency to a subject , where frequency be select accord to the expect `` normal '' range of human hearing and include many frequency at the minimal level of audibility .
