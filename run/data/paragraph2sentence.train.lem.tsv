after read Wheatbelly -lrb- from Amazon -rrb- , I have finally come to term with the need to go really low-carb and avoid grain .but what to do about the need to snack and dip occasionally ?these fit the bill perfectly : spicy , crunchy , healthy and gluten-free .I just wish they be available on subscribe & save now that I know they be terrific .	high carb snack mess with my insulin level , leave I feel drain all day .
great noodle , but a little spicy .if you like spicy then put the whole flavor packet in bowl but if I like mine a little less spicy so only put half or 3/4 of packet and it come out tasty .	the noodle taste great but the spice can be overpower so consider use half or 3/4 of a packet for a great taste .
this be not the original swiss Maggi Seasoning Sauce .it be very close and taste fine , but be aware while the trademark remain swiss , this particular product be make and bottle in Mexico .	unlike the original swiss Maggi seasoning sauce , this stuff be make in Mexico .
I like all kind of mac and cheese .my homemade version use cream , Beecher 's cheese and dungeness crab .but then on the other hand , I also like both Stouffer 's and Trader Joe 's frozen , and I even like the stuff in the blue box .read a lot of rave review of Annie 's , so I pick up a box at the store today .I be not sure what kind of mac and cheese the people that love this stuff have eat in the past , but I find Annie 's watery and bland .I think it might be passable if there be twice the amount of cheese powder , but this stuff have no flavor .eat a couple bite and throw the rest out .luckily I only buy one box , but it be a complete waste of money .even Easy Mac be better .	Annie 's mac and cheese be a waste of money - watery and bland , despite its rave review .
this be my first for adventure into yellow curry paste , and I love it .even though it be not as hot as some of the other curry 's , the level of spice and flavor do not disappoint .I follow the recipe on the side of the container .it do use the european scale of measurement that at first be a little intimidating .I do notice under nutrition , that it it list 2 teaspoon be 10 gram .that mean that 50 gram be 10 teaspoon .there be no law that say you can not use more .I intend to hit the net for more recipe , plus i have some of my own idea , hey , fake it till you make it .the flavor profile in this yellow curry allow you to take a all expense pay , trip through your own imagination .	Curry paste may vary in color base on the ingredient and while all contain the same main ingredient -lrb- curry -rrb- , flavor can vary significantly - as well as the heat !

I have never try the Celtic Sea Salt before but have read a lot about it be better than regular salt for you .I buy this and be very pleased except that I believe I would have prefer to have buy the fine ground .this work great for cooking but you need a grinder to use at the table .taste just like salt .I can not tell any difference in taste from the iodize table salt .it definitely look different .it be a moist gray color .very pleased .convert over to this as I empty out the salt grinder .ca not tell you how it react to the grinder yet .	celtic sea salt taste just like regular sea salt but it come in these large granule that be big enough that I have to use a grinder to add the salt to food .

I be use this flour to make the recipe in Bruce Fife 's book that I just purchase cooking with Coconut Flour .the cookie and bread have great texture , I love the fried chicken , and the italian meatloaf .very glad that I buy the flour and the book because coconut flour be difficult to experiment with as it soak up moisture like a sponge .turn out you need to add more fat , not water or milk , if you want the batter to be moister .

I would be look for a apple preserve and Harvest song seem to fit the bill .they have get a wonderfully idyllic print marketing campaign so I think I would take a chance.as it turn out , the aluminum lid on the jar have no protective liner .my first 1/8 of a teaspoon be fill with metal !the acid in the jam have corrode the interior of the lid , produce scratch mark that look like someone scratch it with the tine of a fork.i be call Amazon to see if they 'll refund on defective food .really people ... run for you lives.update : I feel a little sick from this product but it clear up in about 12 hour .when I feel better I call Amazon -lrb- through the contact Us link near the bottom of the page -rrb- and receive a full refund .thanks for the great customer service Amazon .	this jam be so acidic that it eat through the metal lid , make the top of the jam fill with metal .
very soft and yummy cookie .I buy these for my gluten-intolerant daughter and wind up like they myself !they have other flavor that be also very good .my daughter 's favorite be the chocolate chip cookie .I think they be all good .we have also have the apple flavor .	for people with IBS , gluten can cause severe abdominal cramp and , in extreme case , lead to hospitalization due to dehydration .
this be very good coffee at a excellent price .I like a dark roast and order this not realize that Vienna roast be more of a light roast .if I have order a darker roast from they I might have be able to give they 5 star .in any case , I be pretty sure I 'll order they coffee again -- maybe the Sumatran next time .	the ingredient list be short -- coffee , sugar , potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate .
the good news , these be very tasty and pretty fill for 210 calorie .the bad news ?for nutritional value they be slightly better for you than the average candy bar .a tasty snack , but do not get the idea that its health food .	they would not eat it at all .
just have this for the first time at PF Chang 's in Sacramento yesterday .I be utterly amaze at how good it be and I be a tough critic , have be a long-time Earl Grey lover .it be great with food because the taste be light and refreshing ; it be also delicious , by the way .it be perfect for summertime , perfect frosty cold with lot of ice .and it be real tea , not a powder .it smell so good I almost want to wear it !can you tell ?I love this tea !	this Earl Grey tea be real tea -lrb- not powder -rrb- and better than everything else because the taste be delicious , light , and so refreshing .
this be a smoky , creamy , and just very mildly spicy sauce .if that be what you be look for you would likely enjoy it a lot , but for I , it make figure out just what to do with it a little difficult .typically when I make taco , etc , I just use salsa , sour cream , and sometimes hot sauce , so I be struggle a bit to figure out where this fit in exactly .it taste good , but seem almost unnecessary .one use that seem to work pretty well be add it to a taco salad .it be kind of a nice addition to keep the flavor a bit more interesting and I might keep some around for that .it could also add a bit of variety to sandwich if one be in the mood for something a little different than the norm ; perhaps on a southwest style Panini or similar .I might also try it for dip chicken nugget or wing , etc. .overall it seem like a pretty good product , but not something I would be likely to use daily or even a couple time a week , so I may pick up a bottle every now and then but I probably will not buy a 6-pack of they .I would rate it perhaps 4 star on taste but it lose a few point for versatility since it be not really hot sauce , taco sauce , salsa , sandwich spread , or salad dress , it be kind of something else that I have trouble classify .	there be a good amount of raisin , but the almond be rather sparse .
I have be drink Whey up since 2007 and I love it !there be not another protein energy drink on the market that taste as good or work as well .I drink at least one Whey up a day and can certainly feel my energy level increase when i drink it before a work out .it be also be a great source of meal replacement with 20g of protein and again , it taste great !I even pack bottle of wheyup when I travel and have go to great measure to get more whey up if i run out .people who work out should drink WHEYUP for the protein energy boost they get before go to the gym .I have also point out to people that be dieting that they should drink WHEYUP as a meal replacement -lrb- once a day -rrb- and then keep fill the bottle with water for the rest of the day .I love that AMAZON be now sell WHEY up and everyone should try it !	a nice benefit of have a protein shaker be be able to fill it up with water after and keep drinking throughout the day to stay hydrated .
the brownie be not rich , not chocolate chunk ... only a few chip on top ... much much smaller than the picture ... not chewy ... soft and mushy like the cheapo one you get at the grocery store ... be in the box in 4 stack of four and the bottom brownie on each stack be smash to half size and the rest be all stick together ... the box they come in be beautiful and worth much more than the contents ... I pay $ 32 + $ 11 shipping for 16 small brownie crumble that be only worth about $ 5 if they be not stick together ... draw be reluctant to give refund , and would only respond to my e-mail with one-sentence Blackberry reply , so I give up	to I the key to buy this -lrb- or almost any item -rrb- on amazon be to do a search first .
this drink have a wonderful orange citrus flavor .it be robust but not too strong .a great natural alternative to soda .my 13 year old likes it as well .would not hesitate to purchase .	if you suffer from heartburn , acid reflux , this be the ideal way to continue enjoy coffee drinking .

this be the best dark cocoa I have ever have !it make incredible mocha and hot chocolate and I use hardly any sugar in it -lrb- I like it a little bitter -rrb- and it make a mocha better than Starbucks , Ryan Bros , Butch Bros , Peets - anyone .it make I feel good know there be a lot less sugar , but I do wonder about the fat content as it seem a lil bit on the high side .this stuff be the good stuff .if I could give it 10 star I would !	this dark cocoa be fantastic and ideal for make better mocha and hot chocolate than what you 'll get in any commercial coffee place .
these chocolate bar straddle the line between light , fluffy delicacy and rich , choclate goodness .I can not recommend these enough as I be completely addict .	these chocolate bar do not sit in you stomach like other do so I can not stop eat they !
I purchase this wine a while back , direction be great .only problem I have be open the bag of concentrate !very difficult , other than that when bottle the wine the flavor be great !we be wait about 2 month to really let the flavor set in .everyone at work want some wine , think this will have to be purchase again soon for a new batch !	I purchase this wine concentrate -lrb- which be a bit hard to open -rrb- and have be sit on the wine for two month wait to drink it - despite the demand from coworker to try it .
**** i enjoy bergamot a lot , but this tea be way too fragrant for I ; still it be different and enjoyable to try .the bergamot flavor be strong , not subtle , and a bit overwhelming -- it be all you can taste.the ingredient of this tea be premium black tea with pure oil of bergamot -- that be all.the manufacturer write : oil of bergamot come from the rind of a citrus fruit which grow very well in the Calabria region of Italy .pure top quality oil of bergamot be expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.Certain Earl Grey fanatic have grow especially fond of the top grade calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have ask for more , ..more , ... more !thus be bear Stash double Bergamot Earl Grey .in we double Bergamot Earl Grey tea , the black tea base still serve as a solid foundation for this blend , but the oil of bergamot take wing and soar to new unprecedented height .the flavor be quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils .be the flavor too strong ?for a conservative drinker , maybe yes , but more adventurous type really seem to like it.i must not be adventurous enough .I do agree with the manufacturer , though , and it might be the tea for you if you be a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it , and I also agree that it taste pure , not soapy or bitter at all .	**** the bergamot do not taste too soapy at all .
this be the best ghee that I have try but perhaps it be because it be the only ghee that I have try !it taste more oily than buttery and it do not add much flavor to food which could be a plus or a minus depend on what you be cooking .I be try to avoid casein and this product have be very helpful in stick to that avoidance !	although I have only ever try this ghee , it seem to do the job but be a bit more oily than butter .
I be hook on this cappuccino - it be a great pick I up in the afternoon without give I a caffeine rush .the package of 3 box be a great price and they do not take long to get here .	this cappuccino be a great afternoon energizer .
this be a tasty little instant coffee .you can smell the light and refreshing mint as soon as you start stir it up .the chocolate flavor be delicious and the mint be very uplifting .I feel like I be experience a little bit of aromatherapy !it be almost a slight menthol sort of fresh , clean , peppermint scent and flavor.while regular hot chocolate be cozy and warm , this have a bit more caffeine from the coffee and with the energize peppermint add to it , it make for a really nice afternoon pick-me-up .and compare to get coffee out at big name coffee shop -lrb- as much as I enjoy that coffee too -rrb- , this be very economical .Got ta love a affordable indulgence !thank you , Maxwell House!yum !	:-rrb- hot chocolate with whip cream and maybe a dash of peppermint really hit the spot on a cold winter 's day .
I use this flour to make homemade egg noodle , and they be really gross !they smell like vegetable and taste even worse .I have make gluten-free noodle before with a white rice flour blend , and they turn out great .I recommend Whole Foods 365 brand or Gluten Free Pantry brand all purpose flour -lrb- 1st ingredient white rice flour -rrb- for cooking and bake .those blend look and feel more like white flour , and you usually can not even tell the product be gluten free .	this gluten-free flour be terrible and make you allrecipe smell like vegetable and taste even worse .
I receive really delicious raw honey and that make I happy .the texture be really nice and smooth to boot .I do end up find the product for less at local grocery store , but that be my own error .this be a really great product all around .	this raw honey be a bit more expensive to buy online , but it be too delicious and smooth to pass up .
I be pretty sure this be the same sauce they use at Taco Bell on the Baja Gordita and Chalupa .it be pretty mild , so you can use it generously !the texture be a little thicker than the other Taco Bell sauce , so this work best as a sandwich spread , since it will not run off as easily as the other varity .I also like it as a hamburger top , but this be a nice chicken dip sauce too .if you be make taco salad , this be the dress of choice !	this taco sauce 's consistency be a bit thicker than Taco Bell 's .
yes !!!I finally find a quality food that all 3 of my cat love !I have try several other -lrb- halo , paul newman , taste of the wild , core , and other -rrb- and this be the first one I can tell that they really go wild over.plus the price be not as high as some of the high quality foods.if they continue to love it this much and get along well with it I will definatley continue to buy this brand.would have do 5 star but it be pricey for normal people and kind of inconvenient to always be buy at a pet store or online but I do like it well .	Granny smith be the best flavor to get in my opinion .
we trust Beneful and these day with so many scary story about dog get sick from treat or dog food that be make in China , it be very important to trust .my dog always have a appetite for Beneful .she be be eat it for year and still devour it .I love this 15.5 lb .bag .we just keep it in the garage and scoop it out when it be din-din time .a airtight seal keep it fresh .	best of all , thanks to the right blend of fiber , I only need to let my dog out twice a day with no accident due to upset tummy .
